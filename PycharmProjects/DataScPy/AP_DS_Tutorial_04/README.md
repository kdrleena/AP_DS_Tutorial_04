## Exercises Completed

### Exercise 01: Temperature Analysis with NumPy
- Created temperature array for 3 cities over 7 days
- Computed maximum temperatures per city, per day, and overall
- Identified location of maximum temperature
- Compared temperatures between cities
- Added average temperature row
- Found days where Annaba was hottest

### Exercise 02: Hospital Data with Pandas
- Created DataFrame with patient data
- Added calculated columns (TotalCost, AgeGroup)
- Performed column operations (add, rename, delete)
- Applied data transformations and categorizations
- Implemented ranking and sorting
- Generated city summaries and statistics
- Calculated risk scores and categories
- Exported results to CSV files

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python tutorial_04_solutions.py
   ```

## Results
The script generates comprehensive analysis outputs and exports two CSV files with the processed data.
